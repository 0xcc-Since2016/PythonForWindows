== ctypes_generation ==

I promise i will make a real README at the root of the project.
I don't have the need (nor want to code) a full C parser but i need to parse some windows definition
to generate some python function/struct/flags.
So, there are 3 dumb parser used to generate:
    - function prototype
    - ctypes struct definition
    - flags (int with name)
    
Maybe one day I will do something clean and sane.
But not today.
sorry :(
