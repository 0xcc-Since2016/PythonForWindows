TODO:
    - Documentation
    - ProcessMemory object ? (metasm like)
    - Extend Registry feature (write)

    - remove pe_parse.transform_ctypes_fields (use utils.transform_ctypes_fields)
    - DBG
        - Verif multiple bp at same place..
        - Verif multiple pending at same place
        - Test !! (bp, BP_HX, bp on only on process, bp_hx on only one thread..)
		- test breakpoint with specific target


    - Threading
        - Quid IAT hook stub ? just einit threads and remove this ?

    - Injection
        - code generated by generate_python_exec_shellcode_64[32] may be reused
            Just need to passe the address of the python string as argument

    - rewrite generate_stub_64[32] : it's a non-sens to not save stuff on the stack..
        I can re-copy the args on stack..

    - Winproxy:
        - rethink OptionalExport ? not useful with lazy resolution (or we need to force resolution..)

	- Readme

		- Debugger ? Veh ?

    - TransparentApiProxy

        double name (params and args) for same info..

    - 32 <-> 64

        * What about ``NtWow64QueryVirtualMemory64`` ?


FIXME:
    - WMI
        - COM initialisation when injected in another process
        - The CoInitialize might be already called
        - Fix that

    - setup.py build seems to raise an error
    - winutils.create_process : use WinProcess._from_handle

    - Push("[ECX]") in simple_x64 as a "H" rex and i think it should not..
