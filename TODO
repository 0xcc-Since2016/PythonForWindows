TODO:
    - Documentation

    - Better WMI interface
        - Bug in VARIANT_TYPE == BOOL (see Win32_OperatingSystem->Debug)

    - DBG
        - Verif multiple bp at same place..
        - Verif multiple pending at same place
        - Test !! (bp, BP_HX, bp on only on process, bp_hx on only one thread..)
		- test breakpoint with specific target

    - Rethink/adapt Debugger._explicit_single_step
        Does not handle case where EEFlags.TF was by the debugge before trigering the exception
        Should set the flag explicitly in single_step ? and not just use EEFlags.TF ?

    - remotectypes
        - pretty sur I can get rid of PointerToStruct64/PointerToStruct32

    - Some test/doc on windows.system.handles

    - registry
        - test !

    - Clean pe_parse.py
